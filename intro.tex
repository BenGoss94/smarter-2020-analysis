\section{Introduction}

The following report has been written in preparation for the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference. It is a review of the global greenhouse gases abatement potential estimates achieved by ICT solutions, based on the data from the SMARTer 2020 report.

This work critically evaluates the methodologies and data used in the SMARTer 2020. Focusing on the uncertainty in estimating the addressable emissions and abatement potentials for each sublever in the 6 end-user sectors outlined by the report.

It only considers some of the sublevers from the SMARTer 2020 report as an example. It aims to point out the flaws in the modelling approach, not to disregard the data entirely, and as such should be viewed only as a tool for reviewing the global abatement potential accuracy stated in SMARTer 2020.
